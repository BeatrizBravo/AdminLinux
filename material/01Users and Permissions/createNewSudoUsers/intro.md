ABOUT THIS LAB

In a proper production environment, not every user that needs elevated privileges for a server will have the root password. Instead, those users that need to perform system administrative tasks would be granted the ability to use the sudo command when elevated privileges are needed. This learning activity will provide an opportunity to create new users that will be granted varying degrees of sudo access.

OBJECTIVES

Create two new users.
Verify the `/etc/sudoers` file and test access.
Set up the web administrator.
