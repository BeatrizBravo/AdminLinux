## Description
In this lab, we are going to manage users and groups to get some practice using these utilities. Knowing how to manage users and permissions means our servers will be more secure.

## Scenery
We have some users that need to be set up on a new machine.

Tony Stark, Diana Prince, and Carol Danvers are developers for a project we're involved with. 

We need to add user accounts for them to the server, and then create the **superhero group** for all of them to be members of.

Tony Stark is a superuser, so we'll replace his primary group with the **wheel** group.

But wait! We realize a couple weeks in that Diana Prince has been forced to take leave, in order to fight evil. We'll have to lock her account until she can return.

To get started, log in to the lab server using the credentials provided and then become **root** by running:

`sudo -i`

## Objectives
* Add the Users to the Server
* Create the `superhero` Group
* Set `wheel` Group as the the `tstark` Account's Primary Group
* Add `superhero` as a Supplementary Group on All Three Users
* Lock the `dprince` Account

# Managing Users in Linux


## Introduction
In this lab we are going to manage users and groups to get some practice using these utilities. Knowing how to manage users and permissions means our servers will be more **secure**.

## Solution
Log in to the server 
`ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
`
Become root:

`sudo -i
`

Enter password at the prompt.

1. Add the Users to the Server:

```shell
useradd tstark
useradd cdanvers
useradd dprince
Create the superhero Group

```

To see a list of users in Linux, you can use various commands. Here are a few methods:

- Using the **getent** command:
`getent passwd
`
This command will display a list of all users on your Linux system.

- Using the ls command:
`ls /home`   This command will list the home directories of all existing human users on the system. Please note that this method may also show home directories of past users who have been removed.
- Using the compgen command (bash shell only):
`compgen -u`   This command will return a list of users in databases that can be enumerated.

2. Create the new group:

`groupadd superhero`

To see a list of groups in Linux, you can use different commands. Here are a few methods:

- Using the getent command:
`getent group`
This command will display a list of all groups on your Linux system.
- Using the /etc/group file:
`cat /etc/group`
This command will display the contents of the /etc/group file, which contains information about all the groups on your Linux system.
- Using the groups command:
`groups`
This command will display the groups that your current user is a member of.

3. Set **wheel Group as** the tstark Account's **Primary** Group

The usermod command will change which group a user is in. Change tstark:

`usermod -g wheel tstark`


Make sure it worked:

`id tstark`


The command's output should show his primary group is now wheel.

4. Add **superhero as a Supplementary Group** on All Three Users
4.1. Run the usermod command for each user:
```shell
usermod -aG superhero tstark
usermod -aG superhero dprince
usermod -aG superhero cdanvers
```

Check with any of the users to make sure it worked:

`id <USERNAME>
`

We should see they're now in superhero, as well as their own groups.

5. Lock the dprince Account
Run the following:

`sermod -L dprince
`
check if a user account is locked in Linux:

- Using the passwd command:

`sudo passwd -S <username>
`
Replace <username> with the actual username of the account you want to check.
The output will display information about the user account, including the password status. If the account is locked, you will see the letter 'L' in the password status field.

- Using the getent command:

`getent passwd <username>`

Replace <username> with the actual username of the account you want to check.
The output will display the user account information, including the account status. If the account is locked, you will see a '!' or '*' symbol in the password field.
